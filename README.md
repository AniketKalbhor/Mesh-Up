# Emergency Mesh Network

This project demonstrates a mesh network solution for disaster-affected areas where traditional communication infrastructure is unavailable. The system leverages IoT devices (e.g., ESP8266), desktops, Raspberry Pi, and mobile devices to form an ad-hoc mesh network, enabling decentralized communication in emergency scenarios.

## üöÄ Features

- **Ad-hoc Mesh Networking**: Devices form a decentralized network, automatically discovering and connecting with peers.
- **UDP-based Communication**: Lightweight and efficient message exchange using UDP protocol.
- **Message Rebroadcasting**: Ensures messages propagate through the network.
- **Device Interoperability**: Supports platforms like ESP8266, Raspberry Pi, laptops, desktops, and Android devices.
- **Flood Protection**: Prevents message duplication using unique IDs and a history log.
- **Message Acknowledgment**: Ensures message reliability and traceability.

## üìú Message Structure (UDP Header)

Messages transmitted over the UDP protocol include the following structure:
[Message ID] | [Origin Device ID] | [Message Content]

### Components:
1. **Message ID**: Unique identifier for each message, composed of the device‚Äôs `DEVICE_ID` and a random suffix (e.g., `123abc-5678`).
2. **Origin Device ID**: The unique ID of the device that originated the message.
3. **Message Content**: The actual communication payload.

### Example:
123abc-5678 | 123abc | Emergency at Location X

### Key Benefits:
- **Uniqueness**: Prevents message duplication.
- **Traceability**: Identifies the source of the message.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures meaningful communication.

## üõ¥ Getting Started

### 1. Setting up the IoT Device (ESP8266)
1. Connect the ESP8266 to your computer.
2. Open the provided code (`ESP8266_MeshNetwork.ino`) in the Arduino IDE.
3. Configure the `SSID` and `UDP_PORT` if required.
4. Upload the code to the device.
5. Power the device and observe the serial monitor for network activity.

### 2. Using the Java Swing Client
1. Compile and run the `MeshNetworkClient.java` file.
2. Connect the device to the same Wi-Fi as the mesh network.
3. Start communicating via the GUI.

### 3. Using the Android App
1. Import the project into Android Studio.
2. Open `MainActivity.java` and ensure the necessary dependencies are installed.
3. Build and install the APK on your Android device.
4. Connect the mobile device to the mesh network Wi-Fi.
5. Start the app to send and receive messages.

## üõ°Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Network Formation**:
   - Each ESP device creates an open SoftAP network.
   - Devices scan for and connect to nearby open networks, forming a mesh.

2. **Message Transmission**:
   - Messages are tagged with unique IDs (`DEVICE_ID` + Random Suffix).
   - Sent messages are broadcasted over the mesh using UDP.

3. **Message Handling**:
   - Devices receiving messages check for duplication using the `Message ID`.
   - Non-duplicate messages are acknowledged and rebroadcasted.

4. **Java Client**:
   - Connects to the mesh network.
   - Allows users to view, send, and track messages in real-time.

5. **Android App**:
   - Acts as a portable node in the mesh.
   - Facilitates mobile-based interaction for disaster management.
